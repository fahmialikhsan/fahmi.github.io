Dating Advice For Men From The Biological Standpoint</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Are you one of the millions of men who wonders what makes women tick? Why do some men have all the luck with women and others can't even seem to get a date? Here's some dating advice for men from a biological point of view.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As you've probably already figured out, women do not think like men. So don't make your decisions based on what you would say, think or act like. And the first thing you need to do is focus more on how women show what they want instead of what they say what they want.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Some women are consistent what they say and what they show. But many times, this isn't the case. A woman may say that she wants someone who listens to her. But the guy she decides to date is someone who is always talking. She says the most important quality in a man is his sense of humor. But she chooses a really good looking bore.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Why does this contradiction take place? In their defense, women don't do this consciously. It happens because what the women thinks she wants and what she biologically needs may be two different things. Biologically, women are wired to have children. And their natural instincts are to choose the best provider for themselves and their children. This doesn't necessarily mean he will be a good listener or have a great sense of humor.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Again, take this dating advice for men from the biological point of view. . .women are looking for men who will be good providers in both the short and long term. They see this quality in healthy, strong, confident men.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Another point they will focus on (even if they don't tell you this, and even if they tell you otherwise) is your job. Once again, it's all about being a good provider. The better job or the more career goals you have, the better you look in her eyes.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
And it's not just about the money. Women want to see that their men know how to manage their money in a way that it is beneficial to the whole family. This is one reason that many women really place a high value on expensive gifts. Take jewelry for example. When you give a woman a piece of jewelry, you are showing her in a roundabout sort of way that you can provide for in the future.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Nowadays most people make livings by using their brains and not their brawn. But women are still wired to perceive strength as equal to the ability to provide.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So, the biggest piece of relationship advice for men is to figure out what women need from an evolutionary point of view and give it to her.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hopefully this dating advice for men from a biological viewpoint helps you get an idea of what women are really looking for, whether they know it or not!</div>
